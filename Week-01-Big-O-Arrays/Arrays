ARRAY - stores a collection of elements (values or variables) of the same data type in contiguous memory locations

Memory - known as ram, temporarily holds data. This is where elements of array are stored
Storage - known as rom, permanently holds data.

Characteristics of an array
  1. Contiguous Memory: Elements are stored sequentially in memory, which allows for fast, direct access to any element via its index.
  2. Homogeneous Elements: Typically, all elements in an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all strings).
  3. Fixed Size: Traditional arrays have a predefined size, though many modern programming languages offer dynamic arrays that resize automatically.
  4. Index-Based Access: Elements are accessed using an index, usually starting from up to , where is the number of elements.
  5. Dimensions: Arrays can be one-dimensional (a simple list), two-dimensional (a table or matrix), or multi-dimensional. 

Time complexities
  - Accessing and inserting = O(1)
  - Inserting and deleting = O(n) 

Note: the time complexities still depends on the command used.
