Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

Example: 
  Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]
  Output: true

  Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  Output: false

Hints:
  1. A brute force solution would be to check every element against every other element in the array. This would be an O(n^2) solution. Can you think of a better way?
  2. Is there a way to check if an element is a duplicate without comparing it to every other element? Maybe there's a data structure that is useful here.
  3. We can use a hash data structure like a hash set or hash map to store elements we've already seen. This will allow us to check if an element is a duplicate in constant time.

Given: 
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
