🚀 MY DSA JOURNEY

Welcome to my personal knowledge base for Data Structures and Algorithms. I am currently deep-diving into the core fundamentals of Computer Science to improve my problem-solving skills and write more efficient code.

🎯 GOALS AND FOCUS

This repository is more than just a collection of solutions; it is a study on efficiency. For every problem solved, I focus on: 
  
    ⋅ Time Complexity: analyzing how the runtime scales with input size.
    ⋅ Space Complexity: minimizing memory usage and understanding trade-offs between speed and storage.
    ⋅ Pattern Recognition: identifying underlying patterns rather than memorizing code.
  
🧠 WHY COMPLEXITY MATTERS

In this repo, you will see me moving from Brute Force approaches to Optimized solutions. I am fascinated by how selecting the right data structure can drastically alter the performance of an application.


This will serve as the foundation of my future projects. Goodluck to me
