<h1 align="center">🚀 My DSA Journey</h1>

<p align="center">
  A personal knowledge base for Data Structures and Algorithms.<br>
  <b>Focus:</b> Efficiency, Time Complexity, and Optimization.
</p>

<br>

## Goals and Focus

For every problem solved, I focus on:

* **Time Complexity:** analyzing how the runtime scales with input size.
* **Space Complexity:** minimizing memory usage and understanding trade-offs between speed and storage.
* **Pattern Recognition:** identifying underlying patterns rather than memorizing code.

<br>

## Why Complexity Matters

In this repo, you will see me moving from **Brute Force** approaches to **Optimized** solutions. I am fascinated by how selecting the right data structure can drastically alter the performance of an application.
